Attractions include (but are not limited to) the St. Johns River, Jacksonville Beach, Neptune Beach, Atlantic Beach, and Black Rock Beach. Other destinations include wildlife sightseeing, camping, golfing and hiking/biking trails. The City of Jacksonville has more than 80,000 acres of parks. Sporting events are frequented in the area as the region is home to several minor league sports teams and home of the Jacksonville Jaguars of the National Football League. There are many annual events that occur in the North Florida TPO region which include (but are not limited to) the World Of Nations Celebration, the Gate River Run (USA 15K Championship Race), The Players Championship, the Jacksonville Jazz Festival, The Kingfish Tournament, and the Florida/Georgia college football game.\nThe goal is to increase the number of multi-modal projects in high tourism areas and provide transportation connectivity to tourists within the region.

LOTTR assesses the consistency, or dependability, of travel times from day to day or across different times of the day on the State Highway System (SHS).\nThe map shows the critical Level of Travel Time Reliability of the four time periods (AM Peak, Mid Day, PM Peak, and Weekends) in 2023.\nSource: Level of Travel Time Reliability (LOTTR)\n\nLOTTR MapTTR Segment Table\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data for travel time reliability was collected through the FDOT Sourcebook. The inputs included in this stem from historic data from vehicle probes, permanent and temporary count sites, HERE travel time data and FDOT’s roadway characteristics inventory. The top corridors within the region were analyzed which include I-10, I-95, I-295, SR-10, SR-13, SR-21, SR-200, US-1, US-17, and US-90.\nThe 2022 LOTTR data is reported for the months of October, November and December, and takes the maximum value calculated throughout the period. The 2019 – 2021 LOTTR data was taken from the TPOs 2023 Annual Mobility Report.\nMore detailed analysis of the travel time reliability was performed on the most congested corridors within the region. This index is the ratio of the 80th-percentile travel time and the median travel time. For a 10-minute trip with a level of travel time reliability of 2.5 you have an 80% chance of arriving within 25-minutes. The larger the level of travel time reliability the more variable the travel times are along each corridor. Table 8 summarizes the LOTTR values and the corresponding critical segment."
