Based on the FDOT roadway characteristics inventory, the average pedestrian facility coverage over the four counties within the North Florida TPO area is 65.62% for 2022. Year over year, the total pedestrian coverage within the North Florida TPO region generally increases, resulting in increased sidewalk mileage.\nA map of the FDOT sidewalks and gaps in the region is provided below.\nSource: FDOT Sidewalks and Gaps TDA"

Pavement condition is summarized for Interstate and non-Interstate facilities that are on the National Highway System (NHS). The % is based on the lane-miles of facilities. Bridges are summarized by NHS and non-NHS facilities. The percent is calculated based on the bridge deck area. Goals are set by FDOT for how much of each category is in good condition and how much is in poor condition. Table 10 summarizes the pavement conditions. Table 11 summarizes the bridge conditions. The figures below also compare the yearly breakdown to the target goals."

    "text": "7.4 Transit Vehicles\nMaintaining transit vehicles and systems in a state of good repair is one of the highest priorities for any transit system to ensure safe, dependable and accessible services are provided.\nThe average age of vehicles operated by the Jacksonville Transportation Authority and Nassau Council on aging increased from 2019 with limited fleet replacement (0.3-year average increase) for each. The Sunshine Bus Company replaced a vehicle and their average age decreased.\nThe Jacksonville Transportation Authority assumed the operations of Clay Transit in 2018 and those vehicles are shown as part of the Jacksonville Transportation Authority’s fleet beginning in 2018.\nThe service life for transit vehicles varies by type and is not analyzed as part of this report. Most buses have a service life of 12 years or 250,000 miles. Smaller buses, such as shuttles, have a service life of four to seven years and between 50,000 and 175,000 miles. The people mover vehicles on the Automated Skyway Express in downtown Jacksonville exceed their predicted service life. The vehicles are currently 21 years old. A Skyway Modernization Program is underway.\nThe Mayport Ferry vessel, the Jean Ribault, has been carrying vehicles and people for 24 years, but is in good state of repair. The Jacksonville Transportation Authority assumed operations of the ferry from the City of Jacksonville in 2016."

The external costs included, or those not paid directly by the traveler, are from emissions which result in additional health care costs caused from increase cancer rates, loss of earnings associated with them and the associated negative health impacts. The costs of climate change associated with greenhouse gas emissions from carbon dioxide and oxides of nitrogen are also included. Emissions account for &lt;1% of the social costs of congestion.\nThe social cost of congested increased in 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic similar to other measures of congestion returning to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels.\nThere is no target for the social cost of congestion but the costs should maintain or decline each year."

They represent less than 1% of crashes but 20% of the social costs.\nVehicle crashes result in $3.8 billion per year in social costs.\nThe total social costs of crashes in North Florida is $4.8 billion per year, or 5.9% of our region’s gross domestic product.\nThe target is to have zero injuries or fatalities resulting from crashes."
